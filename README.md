# Programming the virtio-snd-pci (VirtIO paravirtualized sound device) from DOS

Starting out with some programming experimentation. This might eventually evolve into an actual sound driver.

**NOTE**: as of 2024-12-06, QEMU 8.2 is the only freely available hypervisor to my knowledge that supports the
virtio-snd-pci device on the host side.
